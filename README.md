# EOS setup and sample app
##  **SETUP**
 **Prerequisite**
- Git
- Ubuntu 16 or 18 LTS  (Ubuntu 16.10 recommended)

**System Requirements (all platforms)**
- 7GB RAM free required
- 20GB Disk free required

**Overview**
EOS comes with mainly three modules.
- nodeos  - the core EOSIO node daemon
- cleos - command line interface to interact with the blockchain and to manage wallets 
- keosd - component that securely stores EOSIO keys in wallets.

 **Initial installation**
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/eosio/eos --recursive
$ cd eos
```
It will download all the EOS code and its sub-modules

**Build the code**
EOS code can built with multiple ways based on the platform and the desired use.
- Autobuild Script
- Docker compose
- Manual build
- Install executables

Autobuild script is the one suitable for the developers and we are setting up that model.
```sh
$ ./eosio_build.sh 
```
`This will take a  couple of hours depending on the spec of machine`

**Build validation**
Test the build operationâ€™s status(Validation Test) in eos/build directory using the following testing commands.
```sh
#Start mongo
$ ~/opt/mongodb/bin/mongod -f ~/opt/mongodb/mongod.conf &
$ cd build
$ make test
```
**Install the executables**
```sh
$ sudo make install
```
#### **Single node network**
After building the project, you can start the single node by running nodeos
```sh
$ cd ~/eos/build/programs/nodeos
$ ./nodeos -e -p eosio --plugin eosio::wallet_api_plugin --plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin --plugin eosio::history_api_plugin 
```
-e :-    Enable block production
-p  :-   ID of producer controller by the node
--plugin :- To enable multiple plugins

Nodeos uses a configuration folder.The config file ~/.local/share/eosio/nodeos/config can be found in this location.If config.ini is not found a default config.ini is created.

*Issues may arise:-*  
*3190000 block_log_exception: Block log exception*
*Block log was not setup properly with genesis information.*
*Solution* 
*Clear this folder for the issue :-*
*rm -rf ~/.local/share/eosio/nodeos/data*
*Or  ./nodeos --replay-blockchain --hard-replay-blockchain*

#### **Wallet Creation**
Open a new terminal
```sh
$ cd ~/eos/build/programs/cleos 
$ ./cleos wallet create  -n ``<your wallet name> ``
$ ./cleos create key
```
Sample Response
``Private key: 5JmJyTf9cYemDctq3a28UM2YDmr3eDStsHSXv1VqgUbCaHTuCbn``
   ``Public key: EOS8akHPngGi1nfvR55WqiGrTeCtsSLZRvAGT5LBRdrXDmoqQpSXw``

**Import  Private key**
```sh
./cleos wallet import ``<privatekey>``
```
# **Introduction about EOSIO Smart Contract**

   > An EOSIO Smart Contract is software registered on the blockchain and executed on EOSIO nodes, that implements the semantics of a "contract" whose ledger of action requests are being stored on the blockchain.
   > The Smart Contract defines the interface (actions, parameters, data structures) and the code that implements the interface. 
   >  The code is compiled into a canonical bytecode format that nodes can retrieve and execute. 
   >  The blockchain stores the transactions of the contract. 
   >  Every eosio smart contract belongs to a single eosio account.
   > Performing an action to a contract requires the authorization of at least one account. 
   > An account can be made of a single, or many, individuals set up in a permission based configuration. 
Smart contracts can only be run by a single account, and a single account can only have a single smart contract.
   > Note :-
   Best practice - Use the same (lowercase) name for both the account and contract.

## **The eosio.token contract explanation**
   > Allows the creation/transfer of tokens.
   > Every token contract is owned by an owner/issuer account.
